<h2>ðŸ’»Cybersecurity Projects:</h2>

- [<b> Virtual Lab Setup /Vulnerability Scanning </b>](https://github.com/darknite222/Home-Lab-Set-up-Vulnerability-Scanning.git)

  - **Objective:** Create a virtual lab for vulnerability scanning.
  - **Methodology:** My methodology for this project involved careful planning, tool selection, proper isolation, and consistent iteration.
  - **Tool used:** Virtual Box; Nmap; OpenVAS; Zenmap; Nessus
  - **Challenges:** Experience download speed issues due to server overload.  
  - **Results:** Successfully utilized Virtual Box to set up a home lab for vulnerability scanning. 
    
- [<b>Scanning a target machine</b>](https://github.com/darknite222/Scanning-a-Victim-Machine/blob/main/README.md)
  
  - **Objective:** Scan the target machine; to search for vulnerabilities.
  - **Methodology:** When scanning a system for vulnerabilities, the method generally follows a structured approach that includes several stages, from initial reconnaissance to vulnerability 
     identification and analysis. 
  - **Tool:** Virtual Box; Nmap; OpenVAS; Zenmap; Nessus
  - **Challenges:** dealing with false positives/negatives.
  - **Results:** Successfully scanned the target host for vulnerabilities.
    
- [<b>Scanning a target machine for open ports</b>](https://github.com/darknite222/Scanning-a-target-machine-for-open-ports)

  - **Objective:** Scan the host target device to search for open ports.
  - **Methodology:** I chose the application Virtual Box; which allowed me to download VM files.
  - **Tool:** Virtual Box; Zenmap; Nmap; 
  - **Challenges:** The time length of the download, caused the scan to stop.
  - **Results:** I learned how to send packets to specific ports on a host, using the responses to find vulnerabilities.
    
- <b> Exploitation of MySQL Server </b>

  - **Objective:** Scan the target machine; to search for vulnerabilities.
  - **Methodology:**  Utilized OWASP's Top 10 list of web applications' most critical security risks to attack the MySQLserver.
  - **Tool:** Virtual Box; Metasploit; Leafpad; OWASP 10
  - **Challenges:** Technical obstacles; organizational and communication issues
  - **Results:** Successfully exploited the target MySQL server, extracting personal information using Leafpad. 

- <b>Target System Scan Report</b>

  - **Objective:** Create a system scan report based on the vulnerability assessment results.
  - **Methodology:** Created an executive summary, detailing vulnerabilities discovered.
  - **Tool:** Office 365-Word
  - **Challenges:** Translating technical to non-technical when describing vulnerabilities.
  - **Results:** Learned how to create an effective scan report for businesses of all sizes.
 
- <b> Penetration Test Report </b>

  - **Objective:** Create a comprehensive summary of Hotel Dorseyâ€™s penetration result results.
  - **Methodology:** Preparation, defining the scope and rules of engagement, followed by information gathering to map out the target environment.
  - **Tool:** Microsoft Office 365 suite
  - **Challenges:** Performing penetration testing, while essential for identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening security, can come with a variety of challenges. These issues can be 
                    technical, procedural, or even interpersonal.
  - **Results:** Learned how to create an effective penetration test report.
